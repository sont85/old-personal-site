To Family and Friends,
	
	Great news, I have been accepted to Coding House Bootcamp. As you may all know, I have pursuing a career in web development. This is a big step in achieving my goals and am very excited. I thank you all for your support and encouragement this past couple of months. I will be attending the bootcamp starting on June 7th, about a week from now.

	I will be staying at the Coding House for two and half months. During this time, I will be very busy and unavailable to attend any gatherings or events. Please understand that I won't be available but feel free to text or email me. Hopefully I can complete my stay at the bootcamp uninterupted and without any worries. 

	Check out my personal website at luckycode.org. The website contains projects that I have completed. I will be adding more of my work to the site periodically when I am at the bootcamp. Let me know what you guys think, I am grateful for any feedback. Again thank for all your support and we will see each again after two short months. 




									sincerely, Son Truong
